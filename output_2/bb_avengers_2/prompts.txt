Shot 1 (4s): A dusty desert meth lab at sunset, chemical equipment bubbling, blue fumes rising. @Element2 stands at the center holding the infinity gauntlet, glowing stones pulsing. [Thanos, deep commanding voice]: "I am inevitable." Breaking Bad theme music plays ominously in the background, cinematic

Shot 2 (4s): @Element1 bursts through the lab door, wild eyes, holding a glowing golden briefcase. He opens it revealing all six infinity stones on a velvet tray, his eyes widen with greed. Tense breaking bad guitar riff plays

Shot 3 (4s): @Element1 slams the infinity stones onto the lab table, grabs a hammer and crushes them into fine blue crystal powder, sparks of cosmic energy flying everywhere. [Tuco, manic screaming raspy voice]: "Tight! Tight! Tight! Blue! Yellow! Pink! Bring me that shit!" Breaking bad theme intensifies

Shot 4 (3s): @Element2 watches from the doorway, jaw dropped in absolute horror, as @Element1 bags up the crushed infinity stone powder into small drug baggies. @Element1 grins maniacally at @Element2. Dark dramatic breaking bad music crescendo, cinematic wide shot
