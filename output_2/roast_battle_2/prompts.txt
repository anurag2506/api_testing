Crowd erupts laughing, comedic drum hit sound effect, bright stage lighting, photorealistic

@Element2 rushes to the microphone, animated and fired up, pointing at @Element1, jumping slightly to reach the mic. [Kevin Hart, high pitched loud animated screaming voice]: "Bro you named yourself The Rock! You peaked as a geology term! And thank God you went bald because that jerry curl you had in the nineties was a war crime!" @Element1 tilts his head back laughing. Crowd goes wild, comedic roast show atmosphere, photorealistic

Shot 4 (4s):
@Element1 grabs @Element2 by the shoulders and lifts him off the ground effortlessly with one arm. @Element2 flails his legs in the air, arms waving.

Crowd explodes with laughter, confetti falls, dramatic roast battle victory music, photorealistic cinematic wide shot
