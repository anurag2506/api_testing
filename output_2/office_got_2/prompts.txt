Shot 1 (3s): A grand medieval throne room with stone walls and burning torches, the Iron Throne sits at the center. A man in a modern suit and tie walks up the steps and sits on the Iron Throne, crosses his legs casually, grins proudly. Game of Thrones style dramatic orchestral music, cinematic lighting

Shot 2 (4s): @Element2 leans against a stone pillar watching the man on the throne, wearing a Dunder Mifflin polo shirt. He turns and looks directly at the camera with a deadpan smirk. [Jim, dry sarcastic deadpan voice]: "This is the smallest amount of power I have ever seen go to someone's head." Subtle comedic the office mockumentary feel

Shot 3 (4s): @Element1 kicks open the massive wooden doors wearing full knight armor with a beet-shaped crest on the chestplate, charges toward the Iron Throne with a sword raised screaming a battle cry. [Dwight, intense shouting aggressive voice]: "I am better than you have ever been or ever will be!" Epic dramatic battle music

Shot 4 (4s): @Element1 in knight armor wrestles the man in the suit for the Iron Throne, both pulling at the armrests. @Element2 watches from the pillar, looks directly at the camera again with a knowing smirk, shakes his head. Chaotic comedic music mixing game of thrones orchestra with the office theme, cinematic wide shot
